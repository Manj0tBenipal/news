      "review": "This is a really good romcom that I would recommend to any enjoyer of the genre. It's a lot of fluff and there is like 0 drama so if you want some spice or something then this is not for you I guess. Anyways, the series focuses on a prim and proper girl(not really but that's how ml describes here) and a delinquent boy(but not really), and they have differing interests but are both interested in each other and try to get closer to each other. Unfortunately at the start this is kind of mixed in success, but then they get closer and it's good.The series is very cute, and if this seems like something that would interest you I recommend it. Though if you don't like this type of manga which is probably most people then move on I guess, which is why this has like a 7/10 I suppose (its 10/10 in my heart)",

      "review": "At first glance, Kimi to Pico-Pico is a story about a video game otaku suddenly finding himself in the same gaming club as a gyaru brought up on classical NES titles. Looking at it from a broader perspective, it's a story that’s less about the video games themselves and more about the gamers. Old school gamers, competitive gamers, even gamers modding their peripherals or trying to make their own short works in the Game Maker. Of course, it’s also a rom-com filled with references to Japanese computer games. At its core, Kimi to Pico-Pico is a comedy about video games first, even if Japanese peculiarities abouteffective lack of fair use force them to use very blatant ersatzes for many game titles. We get jokes about searching for easter eggs, trying to circumvent modesty shadows to peek under skirts of 3D models and people pointing out the inherent hilarity of the existence of a co-op video game wholly based around parodying stereotypical Japanese politeness. The games referenced are varied, though the series has clear bias towards both the older titles and the works seen as iconic or at least peculiar enough to warrant their mention. Overall, I’m pretty sure that the wide variety of game related topics and jokes will reach anybody with interest in them, even if some references will likely send you for a wiki crawl.\n\nAs for the second pillar of comedy in this series, our gamers, the series doesn’t disappoint either. Characters are both vivid enough to perform their comedic roles and down to earth enough to be relatable. Without spoiling the later developments, the main cast consists of four characters: our main duo of Taichi Oota, introverted gamer otaku and Ageha Onisaki, gyaru girl who got into gaming playing with her father on NES, and the secondary couple of their two seniors at club. The most important thing to know about them is that they have great chemistry, especially the main couple. It’s refreshing to see romantic leads of the series genuinely enjoy each other’s presence this much, especially since it makes their slow progress towards becoming a couple much more believable.\n\nIt’s worth pointing out that this comedy makes full use of both quid pro quo misunderstandings and dramatic exaggerations showing us games from the perspective of the already immersed characters. This gives this series decent levels of fanservice and innuendos, while usually keeping it from overtaking the plot. Though I personally felt like one fanservice arc in the middle was a bit too long and a bit too on the nose with suggestive, exaggerated expressions. I particularly enjoy the fact that Kimi to Pico-Pico occasionally ventures out with its jokes outside the realm of gaming, providing a pleasant and refreshing change of pace.\n\nIf I were to point out the series' main weak point, I’d say it’s the feeling that the ending felt a little compressed, like the series needed two more chapters to properly finish the denouncement. Still, I consider it as distinctly above average with how the series handles it, especially compared to the unfortunate tendency of rom-com manga series to end right at their emotional zenith. While this vague description doesn’t do the series justice, it’s the most detailed one I can give without revealing the key details of the plot.\n\nOverall, I believe that Kimi to Pico-Pico is a masterpiece of a nerd culture rom-com manga. I can honestly rate it 10/10 and recommend it to others.",

      "review": "tl;dr: A hilarious spin off of Nisekoi that has fun playing around with magical girl tropes and such. This manga is a magical girl spin off of Nisekoi that’s based on the short mini-chapters found at the end of some of the volumes of Nisekoi. It’s essentially a parallel world where everyone gets involved with magic girls one way or another. It’s satirical in a sense in that it plays with a lot of the tropes. It’s pretty funny and is constantly adding new things at a fast enough pace that it never feels like it’s getting repetitive or dull, though with it being only fourvolumes I suppose that was nowhere near as difficult to accomplish as with the main series. It does have a serious plot which ultimately culminates in the standard magical girl messages, such as the value of courage and friendship. This plot is pretty generic though, and not something I think is all that good on it’s own.\n\nThe real draw of this manga is in how it uses the cast from Nisekoi is new ways. It does a really good job of taking all the elements from Nisekoi such as personalities, relationships, etc. and have them fit into the typical magical girl storyline. Characters are somewhat different from the main series, but for the most part I think they’re translated pretty well such that a fan of a character in Nisekoi would enjoy seeing them in a new light in this manga. The protagonist this time around is also clearly Onodera, so fans of her are especially likely to enjoy the increased focus on her. The one characters that’s changed to a bizarre degree is Ichijou, who’s pretty much a completely different character with the same name, but I suppose it was necessary as Nisekoi Ichijou wouldn’t really fit the male lead role in a magical girl story well at all.\n\nThe art of this manga I also found more interesting than in Nisekoi. The quality is about the same and the art style is also very similar, but it’s more fantastical so it’s able to do a lot more in terms of more interesting designs and such, especially with outfits. There’s also a pretty big emphasis on fanservice, which considering there was essentially none in Nisekoi results in having a very different feel.",

      "review": "Goodbye, Eri is a captivating and multifaceted manga that enthralls its readers with unexpected twists and turns. It masterfully weaves a narrative around death, employing it as a driving motive that takes us on an exhilarating journey. Yet, as we delve deeper into its intricacies, we find ourselves exploring inception-like realms of reality, where distinguishing between what's real and what isn't becomes an engrossing guessing game. Romantic elements tinge the story, but they are far from easily definable. Instead, they weave an enigmatic tapestry that leaves us pondering the complexities of love and its many facets. And just when we think we've grasped the essence ofthe story, the ending cleverly embraces ambiguity, much like the iconic movie Inception, allowing the reader to choose their own interpretation of the tale's conclusion.\n\nThroughout the manga, we're compelled to question the very essence of the story. Is it about vampires? Or perhaps about two young souls entwined in love? Maybe it's a tale of a solitary boy coping with profound loss. But then again, is it even a story in the conventional sense?\n\nYet, these musings about the setting become almost inconsequential when we realize that what truly matters is the underlying essence of the narrative. It's a story about relationships, beautifully infused with a \"pinch of fantasy\" that elevates the entire experience to new heights.\n\nIn conclusion, Goodbye, Eri is a thought-provoking and artfully crafted manga that transcends traditional storytelling. Its enigmatic nature keeps us engaged, and its theme of relationships imbues the tale with a timeless allure. A must-read for anyone seeking a unique and captivating manga experience.",

Wonderful art, beautiful women and nice wholesome stories. My guy has the same taste in women as I do and I respect him for it. The manga is separated into several stores, all of which have to relation to one another. The characters feel real and well developed considering the length of each story oly being around 10-15 pages. You can really feel the personalities of the characters and that really adds to the overallexperience of reading a doujinshi in my opinion. If you like tall, athletic women with short hair strong personalities this is definitely the one for you. I hope that one day 腐蝕 will get the recognition he/she deserves.",

      "review": "Tokyo Revengers - An Intriguing Tale of Time, Fate, and Redemption Tokyo Revengers, a manga penned by an enigmatic author, weaves a compelling narrative that ventures into the complexities of time travel and its profound impact on human destiny. With its innovative time leap premise, the story grips readers from the outset, exploring themes of second chances, self-discovery, and the indomitable human spirit. At its core, Tokyo Revengers delves into the transformation of its protagonist, Takemichi Hanagaki, a seemingly ordinary individual burdened by regrets and missed opportunities. As he embarks on a journey through time, we witness his evolution from a timid and uncertain young maninto a tenacious figure, determined to rewrite his past and forge a brighter future.\n\nThe character development in this manga is a true highlight, with each persona meticulously crafted and layered. Not only does Takemichi undergo a profound metamorphosis, but the supporting cast also undergoes their own growth, mirroring the complexities of human nature and interwoven relationships.\n\nVisually, Tokyo Revengers showcases a distinctive art style that effectively captures the emotions and dynamics of the story. The action sequences are rendered with finesse, imbuing the battles with a palpable intensity that resonates with readers. Additionally, the character designs exude authenticity, further immersing readers in the world of Tokyo Revengers.\n\nWhile the first two-thirds of the manga maintain a strong and engaging narrative, the latter arcs introduce new complexities that may leave some readers yearning for a more cohesive resolution. The intricate time travel mechanics, while thought-provoking, may at times challenge the readers' ability to fully grasp the implications of each twist and turn.\n\nIn reflection, while Tokyo Revengers offers a captivating and emotionally resonant journey, some readers, myself included, had hoped for a different ending that diverged from the dark and tragic turn it took. The final arc's conclusion, where Mikey-kun succumbs to a demon curse, left me yearning for a more uplifting resolution.\n\nWith such a rich and intricate storyline, the possibilities for a satisfying finale seemed endless. Instead of succumbing to a curse, I envisioned a conclusion where the characters discovered that their battles were fueled by deeper motivations like pride, friendship, or a desire to protect their loved ones. Such an ending would have provided a more profound sense of closure and showcased the characters' growth and resilience.\n\nNevertheless, it is important to acknowledge that storytelling is an art form, and endings can be a subjective matter. The impact and emotions stirred by Tokyo Revengers' finale are undeniable, even if it didn't align with my personal expectations. It is a testament to the manga's ability to elicit strong feelings and provoke contemplation.\n\nIn the end, while I yearned for a different ending, I still wholeheartedly appreciate the journey Tokyo Revengers took me on. It serves as a reminder that, just like in life, stories can take unexpected turns, and the true beauty lies in the emotions and reflections they evoke in each reader.\n\nOverall, Tokyo Revengers remains a profound and thought-provoking manga that will stay with its readers long after the final page is turned. It is a testament to the power of storytelling and the impact it can have on our hearts and minds.\n\n the good character development and compelling themes make this manga a worthwhile journey for fans of both action and introspective storytelling.\n\nOverall Rating: 7.8/10",

      "review": "\"Hikaru no Go\" is a manga that's been around for over 20 years. But it still feels fresh and exciting today. The drawings and stories are still amazing. I just started reading it and I wish I had done so sooner. At first, I wasn't interested because it's about 'Go (碁)', a game that older people often play in Japan. If you haven't read it because of that, I hope this review will change your mind. This manga is very inspiring. It's about Hikaru, Toya, and many young Go players. Seeing them grow and improve makes me want to try new things too. Reading this manga makes mefeel like I should stop making excuses and start doing more.\n\nThe drawings in this manga are really good. The Go boards and Stones and the characters' fingers are drawn in detail. You can even tell who a character is just by looking at their hands. This shows how much respect Sensei has for the game of Go.\n\nMy favorite character is Kurata. He's a bit full of himself and says what he wants, which can make him seem like a kid at times. But that's what makes him so interesting.\n\n\"Hikaru no Go\" is not just about a game. It's a story about growing, trying hard, and following your passion. Even if you don't like Go, you might still enjoy this manga. It's inspiring and fun to read.",

      "review": "A Girl Downstairs, is a romance story of a college student, who surprisingly meets a girl who lives downstairs. With no explicit content, The Chemistry between the lead pairs is soo amazing and great and is what attracted me the most. The story progresses smoothly and all the characters introduced in the series were developed as the story goes on. All the important characters have personalities that may be liked or disliked at first, but at the end, we love most of them. The story is definitely solid part of the manhwa and once you start reading you will get to feel the love, affection,pain, sarcasm, and all the emotions and feelings of the characters. Truly, I started the manhwa after watching 4 eps of anime, and became one of my favorite manhwa. But, the only thing I didn't liked is - ?!\n\nIf you enjoy romance-based stories, I would definitely recommend reading the manhwa. I finished reading the manhwa and it is one of my favorite as of now, So I will rate the manhwa a 10/10.",

      "review": "Not a couple, not friends, not mother and son, not siblings… We have Satoko, a 30 year-old office lady who suffers from loneliness and doesn’t feel satisfied with her life in any way. On the other hand we have Mashuu, a 12 year-old boy who feels ostracized in school and determined to practice and improve his soccer skills which is the only thing to hold onto in his life. What makes this manga so unique is the way balances are created and maintained in the relationship between the main characters throughout the story. How many manga do you think exist out there that either doesn’t defineor couldn’t define the relation between two people? It just sounds impossible, but it's in fact happens in this manga. When they become gradually involved with each other, I bet you’ll find yourself immersed in this odd and warm relationship, and feel like supporting their future. Even if the ending might kind of leave you disappointed since it doesn’t have a proper conclusion, the mangaka’s success about keeping the balances in the relationships must be greatly appreciated.\n\nIndividual thoughts, feelings, behaviors and so many details about human psychology are expressed astonishingly beautiful on just two-dimensional papers, and that’s the reason I’ve decided to write this review actually. Many psychological elements are amazingly presented in this manga, like portrayal of mental pain of past traumas and confrontation with them, development of high empathy, true forgiveness towards yourself and others, etc.\n\nIf you seek psychological depth in the manga you read, then you should really give it a try.",

      "review": "Personally In my opinion, The story was both PEAK and WHOLESOMEEE , not forget to mention about both the amazing drawings and the storyline was 🔛🔝‼️I love these kinds of stories where the male is just a normal office guy working in the same company for years and he was chosen to be the mentor for Kana (aka the girl on the cover ofc)! He’s definitely a great mentor tho! because he was being patient with her in her early weeks while just started working in the same company with sosuke (the male lead) and no matter how many mistakes she did in the job,he told her that its okay while smiling! But most importantly, they’re just so cute together and it’s so WHOLESOMEE I LOVE ITTT!! I don’t know about y’all but this one is definitely one of my favorite wholesome Doujinshi for now!! easily 10/10 from me &lt;3 \n\nI’m Looking forward to the next work from the same Author!!",

      "review": "Jagaaan is... a mixed bag. The first half is off-the-rails crazy. Our main character is a homicidal maniac, working as a police officer in the hopes that he can shoot up people he deems as scum to society (whether that's a comment on police brutality or not is up to interpretation). And then magical frogs rain from the sky, people turn into horrifying monsters, and our beat cop gets the superpower to turn his dominant hand to a gun as a result. The early chapters are slow, but it sets the tone for what the series was supposed to be. Twisted people turn into manifestations oftheir desire, and it's really not pretty. The body horror is drawn beautifully, creating just the right mix of ugly and cool. And our main character is thrown into the mix, because he has to fight other monsters to retain his humanity. \n\nHow? He gets his magical bird mascot character to eat their frog-hearts and shit it out, then he snorts said ball of dung like coke. It's incredible. Like a magical girl from my fever dreams. \n\nUnfortunately, symptoms of Jagaaan's problems start to pop up this early. The series like to introduce side-characters that we focus on as a sort of B-plot, and none of them are even remotely enjoyable even as a \"break\". The first one is a rapist who probably only exists as an excuse to draw sex scenes. The second one is a guy stuck in a woman's body who probably also only exists as an excuse to draw sex scenes. You get the idea.\n\nAfter the hilariously named Deader Land arc is where these issues start to worsen. I heard the artist injured his shoulder, so it's not something I can really blame him on, but the art does take a noticeable quality dive. The unique art style and its ugly, inhumane expressions gradually fade away to something more generic. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the designs of the monsters; while still cool, they really don't retain the same level of body horror that they used to have. \n\nSomehow the B-plot continues to be stupidly meaningless, and everything is tied up rather haphazardly by the end with some trite philosophical debates and monologues about the meaning of life. Still, Jagaaan's strongest points are its characters, and they truly do continue to leave lasting impressions right until the end. That said, I liked how dumb the final arc was, and I mean that in the best way possible. Jagaaan had an incredible start, a rough middle, and a decent ending that's probably a little too happy for me.\n\nOverall, it's... fine, it just didn't live up to what it could have been like early on. If you want to turn off your brain for a little and watch people with cool bioweapons shoot each other's heads off while flying in the sky, this is a good way to pass the time.",

      "review": "Demon Slayer, undoubtedly, is a manga that packs a powerful punch. From its action-packed battles to the beautifully rendered artwork, there is much to admire about this series. The fights in the Demon Slayer manga are nothing short of exceptional, setting a new standard for action sequences in the shonen genre. The simple yet masterful storytelling and dynamic artwork come together to create a series of battles that are gripping, intense, and emotionally charged. As a reader, one is completely engrossed in each fight, feeling like a part of the action itself. The illustrations are not only visually stunning but also incredibly fluid, capturing the movements andexpressions of the characters with remarkable detail. This level of attention to detail makes every fight feel alive and immersive, drawing readers into the heart of the action. \n\nThe characters in Demon Slayer are at the heart of the manga, each contributing unique qualities that make them captivating and relatable. Tanjiro's unwavering determination to save his sister, Zenitsu's growth from cowardice to courage, and Inosuke's wild nature in him.\n\nNow, let's talk about the Hashiras; they have their own struggles, vulnerabilities, and complexities that make them all the more relatable and human. Learning about their backgrounds and motivations adds an extra layer of depth to the manga's narrative.. Together, the characters create a gripping and emotionally resonant narrative that keeps the manga thoroughly engaging from start to finish.\n\nFor the Upper Moons, they have intricately woven backstories and motivations that are unveiled with masterful precision throughout the story. As we delve into their enigmatic pasts, we develop a profound understanding of the demons' struggles, desires, and vulnerabilities, blurring the lines between good and evil.\n\nI also want to talk about the arcs, specifically the final arcs of the story.\n\nWhile the earlier arcs are good, it isn't as good as the final arcs of the story.\nThroughout the final arcs, we witness the Demon Slayers facing their most formidable challenges yet. The battles are not only grand and epic but also deeply personal, as they reflect the characters' growth, resolve, and determination. It's a true testament to the story's ability to connect readers emotionally to the characters, making every victory and loss feel impactful and significant.\n\nMoreover, the final arcs bring the underlying themes of the manga to the forefront, reinforcing the importance of compassion, resilience, and the strength of human bonds. The way the story explores the complexities of good and evil and the shades of gray that exist in between adds depth and nuance to the narrative, elevating it beyond the typical battle-focused shonen series.\n\nThe world-building in these arcs is also commendable, as we get a deeper understanding of the Demon Slayer Corps, the demon hierarchy, and the origin of the demons themselves. The lore surrounding the demon world is expanded, providing a satisfying explanation to many lingering questions while leaving some aspects open to interpretation, adding an air of mystery to the story's conclusion.\n\nFurthermore, the character development in the final arcs is exceptional. The protagonists, particularly Tanjiro, Zenitsu, and Inosuke, undergo profound growth and transformation as they confront their deepest fears and insecurities. It's immensely gratifying to see how far they have come from their initial selves, making their journeys all the more fulfilling.\n\nAs for the upper moons, the final arcs humanize some of the demons, providing insights into their pasts and motivations. This added dimension to the villains adds depth to the conflict, blurring the lines between right and wrong and making the resolution of the story all the more emotionally charged.\n\n\nNow for the flaws:\n\nThe story's initial plot, revolving around the theme of revenge, falls into familiar shonen tropes. While it does eventually evolve, it takes time to move beyond its predictable setup. The pacing can also be uneven at times, oscillating between slow-moving moments and hurried plot developments. More balanced pacing could enhance the overall storytelling. \n\nFLASHBACKS:\nWhile flashbacks are an essential narrative tool to provide backstory and context, I felt that the story occasionally relied too heavily on flashback sequences. This might have caused minor disruptions in the flow of the story for some.\n\nI also want to talk about Muzan Jackson, the primary antagonist of Demon Slayer. \nWhile his initial introduction set the stage for a formidable and menacing villain, his overall character development felt lacking and one-dimensional.\n\nThroughout the manga, Muzan's characterization primarily revolved around a desire for immortality and survival. This singular focus limited the depth of his character, leaving him feeling more like a generic evil figure rather than a fully fleshed-out antagonist with intricate layers of emotion and background.\n\n\nOverall, Demon Slayer is an exceptional manga that stands out with its simple yet compelling storytelling, stunning artwork, and well-crafted characters.\n\n8/10",

This is probably the 100th manga I've read with this exact same setup. There is practically no story here. The manga is so generic it could be copy and pasted from anything. Within the span of a single volume the MC has a harem, taken over the school, and killed the most powerful demon. Every single line of dialogue is predictable. Character development is nonexistent. Again, how or why would anyone care about these characters when they are literalsuper gods? The school drama parts are silly but contain no comedy. In the entire manga I don't think there is a single chapter worth reading.",

      "review": "tl;dr: A manga with a good cast and solid romance, but that drags on too long and feels intentionally frustrating. Nisekoi is a rom-com centered around how the protagonist, Raku, and a girl named Chitoge are forced to date each other despite hating each in order to help calm the conflict between their two families. In a way I guess this is kind of like Romeo and Juliet, in that it features a couple whose respective families hate each other. But I think of it more like a reverse Romeo and Juliet, because instead of the couple wanting to date and the families being against it,the couple doesn’t want to date and the family’s leaders are for it. Instead of trying to hide the fact that they’re in love and meet secretly, they have to hide the fact that they aren’t but having to put on a show of being in love openly.\n\nHowever, in addition to that there’s a plot thread surrounding what happened in Raku’s past. He made a promise with a girl that he was in love with as a kid that when they grew up they would get married, and as proof of that promise Raku got a lock pendant and the girl was given a key. However, he doesn’t remember who that girl was at all and thus is essentially just looking for a girl with the key to his pendent. The thing is that there are multiple girls with keys that remember a promise like that, none of them seem to actually remember who they made the promise with, and furthermore the lock Raku has seems to be broken so they can’t simply use the keys to check.\n\nTo be frank, the plot in the manga was pretty weak. A seemingly core element of the manga is that Raku’s family is yakuza and Chitoge’s family is American mafia which is why the two are in conflict, but that very rarely matters. Early on there’s this thing about how it’s hard for the two to make friends due to their families, but that gets pushed past really quickly. Nothing yakuza or mafia related ever happens. There are supposed assassins but they never assassinate anyone. Eventually a girl connected to the police force and a girl connected to a Chinese triad come in as well. But still, nothing serious happens. Beyond the fact that everyone is super rich, it’s all just aesthetic. It’s actually kind of bizarre how it never plays into anything at all and no one seems to care. Still, I’m fine with manga that aren’t plot focused and rom-coms especially are generally better that way, so while it is disappointing that something that had potential wasn’t used, I don’t see it as a negative.\n\nWhat was a bigger issue is the other core element, the plot line involving the key and lock. While not having a plot I don’t think is a negative, having a bad plot I think certainly is. And while I don’t think the plot is bad necessarily, the way it was told most certainly is. The problem is that is moves incredibly slowly while still constantly being at the forefront. It’s constantly throwing in details that feel like they’re pushing forward in solving the mystery but there’s rarely ever actually any progress. Rather, after it seems like new information is learned, it’ll pretty much always introduce further new information that results in the information previously learned not actually mattering and things being just as mysterious as they were before. It’s frustrating and annoying and wholly unnecessary.\n\nStill, even with the weak plot, the majority of the manga is just the cast living their lives while attending high school so the cast is able to hold up the manga pretty well. Raku is dense and indecisive, but the manga manages to write him pretty well as a good person that genuinely cares about everyone around him so as far as dense and indecisive protagonists go, he’s a pretty great one. None of the heroines are all that deep, but they all have pretty solid personalities and are all written to be pretty likable, so it’s pretty likely that most readers will end up fond of at least one of them.\n\nThe problem is that though there are definite highs and lows, overall things just get too repetitive. While the cast is all pretty likable, no one has a character arc. There are maybe hints of character development here and there, but not enough to matter much in the grand scheme of things. Furthermore, while the cast are likable, they have a very rigid role in the story and they never really step out of it. They’re always in similar situations which they respond to in similar ways without anything too wild ever happening. It becomes immensely predictable and to a degree dull. A lot of the comedy is also rooted in this, and thus while the comedy is decent enough per se, it too starts feeling repetitive and dull. This may not have been a problem when reading it weekly as it came out, but when binge reading it in around a week, I started to feel burnt out on the whole thing.\n\nStill, the romantic aspect I think was handled decently enough that in the grand scheme of things, the manga came out okay. Half of the heroines don’t have a relationship arc, they’re just in love with Raku from before the manga started and remain in love with him. The other half have relationship arcs, but only one felt like it actually fleshed things out properly and was well written. Still, the manga does manage to write all of them being in love and all that fluffy stuff pretty well so everyone’s story is pretty amusing. The one exception that was especially well written was Chitoge’s relationship arc. While her character doesn’t change much over the course of the series, her development of bonds with the other heroines as well as her bond with Raku is really well written and she’s at the center of a lot of very impactful moments.\n\nThe final stretch to the manga also culminates with a heroine getting picked so I’m sure some will be disappointed that their favorite wasn’t. But although it’s somewhat uncertain for most of the manga, during the final stretch it builds up to the conclusion over time in such a way that it felt really obvious long before it got there and regardless of outcome and was also fair to all of the heroines and hits strong emotional beats with all of them. Thus, I feel it was handled as well it possibly could be and I found it a satisfying conclusion.\n\nThe art I felt was too dull. The quality was decent enough and it could be kind of fun with facial expressions. But just in general even for a manga centered around high school, it just felt too plain and like it was never doing anything interesting or trying to look especially nice. In hindsight I feel that may have been a core part of what led to the manga feeling so repetitive.",

      "review": "This story was just boring. Neither the characters, nor the art, or even the plot made it any better. It was so bland that I didn't even bother remembering the names of the characters. I can see how the people would be traumatized and be affected by the troubling times they faced. Still, I just couldn't get into it. And I'm not so sure, but it seemed like it was one of those romantic relationships where one of the partners was abusive and spoiled - which I don't care for at all (no matter what their background may be). There was also no love, Imean there was, but I just couldn't feel it. It was almost like it was there...just to be there. And a world populated mostly by women, not not just have a man be the main character, and show that not all men are evil - there are still plenty of good men. But...whatever. I don't know if other people will like it, but I suppose they should at least give it a chance. Though I personally wouldn't recommend it.",

      "review": "Well this was just disappointing. The whole premise of this manga is that mutant monsters appear on this island and try to devour everything within their sights. We see that humanity fights back, as they call in the military to try and fight these abhorrent mutants. Not much to say about this one honestly. Plot is generic and has been done before a million times. Art quality was fine but the monsters were quite disgusting to look at which made it unpleasant to read. From my perspective it just seemed like a more bland and worse version of parasyte: the maxim. If you're looked fora standard, apocalypse manga where humanity is on the brink of death and they have to fight against these seemingly unstoppable monsters, with some decent artwork here and there, I guess you can read this but if not then you can easily skip this and you'll lose out on nothing. Anyways, I recommend watching or reading parasyte over this because its a very similar concept but executed so much better. If you've seen it already, you'll know what I'm talking about. And if not, then get on it.\n\nOverall: 5/10",

People who think this are mistaken. The anime is good but there are so many little things the anime forgets or makes different! We get to see much more about Tamaki in manga, because the anime never fully adapted the manga (I'm still waiting for season 2 ( T w T)/ ). It's an easy and quick read, with a beautiful story. Please read this manga if you haven't! P.S. My favorite quote: Because I'm a genius, I wasn'ttraumatized!",

This is what happens when he crosses the line and writes doujinshi. If you're here for boobs or for dark skinned girls, you're in for a treat. There's really no real story here, not even time to build one, but you can see the gyaru teasing personality that is characteristic in Ueno's works, but with a twist: since it's a doujin, they actually do go all the way. The girls are cute, the sexis unique for his works, you get exactly what you're searching for. As as fan of Ueno's dumpster fires i loved it, and so will you.",

      "review": "I'm slightly surprised at the relatively low rating this manga has. I approached it with hesitation, fully expecting to drop it in a few chapters, just to continue reading pleasantly surprised. Sure, it has its shortcomings (to be discussed below), but it still is a solid 7-7.5/10 series. So, onto the main selling points of why it's good: 1) ART Marvelous. The shading, the thicker lines of the artstyle, the very expressive foreground (characters, their facial expressions etc.) vs the slightly toned-down backgrounds...The artstyle here is very specific and I haven't seen many other series emulate this kind of mood/feeling. The contrast between the deadpan/stone-faced teacher and the overly expressivestudents is also very well-done.\n\n2) PLOT\n\nWere it just your usual semi-coherent smut featuring some taboo (read: immoral/unethical) relationships, I'd have dropped this in two chapters in at most.\n\nLuckily, the author shifts the tone and focuses on heavier emotional impact, character background (to flesh out everybody's personalities better) and darker undertones. \n\nWhile that's a plus for me, I can see why others who came here for comedy/ecchi would be disappointed. Ultimately this will be the dividing line between liking the series or just putting a 'meh' stamp on it.\n\nWHAT COULD BE BETTER\n\nThat said, I didn't like how it all wrapped up. You'll find out for yourself, and I can see why many people would be stoked for how the series reaches the finish line...But for me it was a bit too convenient of a copout. From various angles - both storyline-related, and ambiguous from a purely moral viewpoint.\n\nAdditionally, some of the chapters were too short/filler-y, which is a big no-no for a series that short. Luckily, they don't detract too much of the pacing/overall mood - but I still wish they were longer/more packed with something of value.\n\nAll in all, though, this was a series that exceeded my expectations. Considering you have only 30 chapters to go through, I highly recommend you blaze through 'Joshikousei to Seishokusha-san' in 2-3 hours of reading. A commendable debut from the mangaka, for sure.",

      "review": "Gay man here... this manga is a contemporary masterpiece, I'm just gonna say that. This whole manga feels like is full of guilt and self constrain... because it feels like that! Is about a gay man who is \"forced\" to have a girlfriend, just by that the idea even for me is awful for real but that's the point, this manga is about morals. Everyone has different ways to cope about their own problems and some of them aren't healthy at all and this work, really knows how to work on that (even I struggle irl to get out of the closet). The ethics on thismanga are just down bad, the way on how they solve their own problems don't really make them \"be\" good people but... who really makes the things in the right way? Usually we just by fear try to protect ourselves from our surroundings and create fields to don't get hurt (just like evangelion, lol) so... I don't think no one can judge the way to cope, really.\n\nThe way on how the narrative is telled is amazing, the characters and the struggles of them feel real (of course, more idealized). The only downside I see is that the leitmotiff of Queen kinda feels forced at times but I'm not gonna lie, when it hits well, hits like a bullet. Even the \"bad\" characters althought they are bad, they are humans and you can feel that all throughout the story. The most important part is the fact that KNOWS when to break up the drama and throw you a joke because... if there wasn't any just to break tension I would be lying on the floor of my room while crying. The art is... great, isn't a masterpiece of drawing like idk Vagabond or name your random manga that is amazingly drawed but is a good relax from the common shoujo/josei that you see everyday, which is nice IMHO.\n\nAny way, I'm writing to much text but you can see what are the lights and shadows of the work and... maybe is because I'm a soft gaycel who struggles with their sexuality why I'm such a bitch with this. I find the main character an asshole but at the same time just an idiot as I (and I know if you read it, this ain't healty) but that's the charm of that jerk. Just stop reading this and go to read the manga, is amazing and made me cry, with that is enough to know that this shit hits hard.",

      "review": "I am a big fan of Higashimura-sensei. Her funny jokes and beautiful pictures make this manga one of my favorites. But, it might be a bit hard for fans from other countries. You need to understand some Japanese to get all the jokes. The title, 'Tarareba', is a good example. It is a mix of two words, 'Tara' and 'Reba'. Both words mean 'if' in English, but also stand for 'Pacific cod' and 'Liver' in Japanese. The characters and the story come from this mix of words. But don't worry if you don't know much Japanese. The story is really good. It's about people who wish theycould change something or want to start something new. I really like the character Key (Kagitani). His words always touch my heart and make me want to do my best.\n\nEven though there are only 31 episodes, every single one is great. You will find:\n\n・Interesting characters\n・A story you can connect with\n・Lines that make you think\n\nIf you're interested in Japanese, or if you ever wanted to change something in your life, I highly recommend this manga. It's more than just a book, it's a journey of emotions and dreams.",

Maybe it is me being used to the main character being cool-headed, but I was only able to feel ok about the FL only after the main story finished. On the other hand, I had no problems with the epilogue. The villain got up to so much unnecessary things, for no good reason except for how she has always stolen the FL's love interests lol. The characters felt very basic, from how I read it, it didn't feel like they had any character development. The only thingthat I can give a thumbs up for is the art. And that's pretty much it.",

      "review": "Yandare warning & dub con (Uke consents but then keeps saying stop, slow down and stop so dub con incase anyone doesn't want to read a story with that) Their second time the uke fully consents and even begs for it, those warnings aside the story is good for a Yandare story, unlike most Yandare stories this one has the Seme give the uke space so the uke can realize he loves the Seme which is very different from most Yandare stories where the Yandare just force themselves regardless of everything. Over all the story revolves around the uke figuring out his feelings towards the seme(the Yandare character) after the Yandare character confesses. Then we see the Yandare and how he has worked to make the uke fall for him. It's hard to say who the MC and ML is because it starts off with the Uke's point of view but then other chapters it's the Semes point of view so they are both the ML &amp; the MC, that is why I just refered to them as Uke &amp; Seme because otherwise it could confuse people. The Smut scenes were hot especially their 2nd time (with the exception of their first time since it was dubcon - that one as well as the ending is what made me rate this a 8 instead of 10)\n\nThis isn't for those who want something cute and fluffy but definitely a really good Yandare story for those who do like the genre. The ending though was abrupt, it felt like it was going to get a second volume however from what I know it doesn't have one. Really hope the author continues this story because it's definitely good with nice art!",

      "review": "The story is like all gyaru stories that are similar, but with the twist that’s it’s from the readers pov. It has the cliches but they are well thought out and so are the main characters you can feel the personality with each female lead. Otaku-kun(you) has no feeling or emotion in his speech, which makes a bit of sense since it’s supposed to be us. But it kinda ruined the pov aspect of it since it felt like I was a robot. It’s extra short so we don’t get to see much of the characters backgrounds but it seemed like there was going tobe alot more chapters some the ending felt a bit rushed. It didn’t completely tie the loose ends which I’m surprised that this manga even had. It’s in full color so it’s extremely easy to see everything, but I’m every chapter the main focus is on one of the four “female leads”. The percentage bar at the end of each chapter was a nice touch and I enjoyed seeing the percentages, it felt similar to a vn which was a nice touch. In the end it was a good time waster which only took me an hour to complete all the chapters.",

      "review": "I wouldn't call it especially ‘bad’… but because I can't call it bad it cant have the status of ‘so bad it's good’. Art (6) Unique but not too unique as to where you might accidentally consider the story good. The lines were clean and the panel spacing was deliberate enough. Characters (???) I can say without a shadow of a doubt that absolutely none of the characters make sense… This is, of course, bad; but so so entertaining. Random plot points are pulled out of the ass of nearly every single character, which they BARELY manage to make work and is so obviously shoehorned in to make theending fluffier. If any of the characters thought for half a millisecond then the story would have ended on the first chapter. Which again is obviously bad but I cant help to find it hilarious. \n\nThere were only three characters I particularly enjoyed, one of them was the comically evil dad and the other showed up in maybe 2 short scenes, thats not exactly a great look for a character-focused story.\n\nStory (4)\n\nIf you're looking for something relaxing to read look elsewhere, it nearly felt like there was a plot point in every single chapter. That speed can have its advantages but in here about halfway through it feels more like the adrenaline wore off and you were just waiting for the end. Even with the pacing the writing must have been the biggest contributor towards ruin, instead of showing romance it's more like they held up a sign saying ‘romance’ and we’re just supposed to go along with it… that could have been excused if this wasnt literally a romance manga. \n\nAll in all, this is the kind of manga you can forget within 30 minutes of reading it, which is for the best since remembering it will just give you a headache.",

The art was just find, but it still wasn't anything to brag about. I also felt that it lacked a proper story. I just couldn't find it funny. I know that it tried, but it just didn't work. And while it tried to give a love triangle...I also think it failed in that category. I don't really know what else to say, other than I just didn't think this was funny or romantic. I will say that while theywere men...they did look good in those tight dresses. \n\nI don't know if other people will like it, but I suppose they should at least give it a chance.

The sci-fi setting is rather intriguing, due to the page limitation we don't get too much information but more than enough to make us interested in more details. You can tell that the author has thought about the world and the characters in it. We are already introduced to multiple storylines of the characters, motivations and worldbuilding. A oneshot that definitely sets the tone for fur further things to come and makes you interested in more. The art is not very standard and pleasant to look at.Very soft strokes with beautiful details on backgrounds, architecture and machinery.\n\nOverall I can recommend this oneshot for a quick read with nice worldbuilding and refreshing art.",

      "review": "Easily a plot that could have been written by Lars Von Trier. Comparable to Nymphomaniac, Antichrist, and The House That Jack Built. It is a series that knew how to work with surprising mastery both human filthiness (on the part of the professor) and the issue of acquired psychopathy (on the part of the girl). It's far from being a hentai manga. It's like he called himself a hentai just to get more attention or get around some weird legislation, like what they did with A-Kite. Anyone who starts reading it simply forgets the erotic content of the thing and ends up being trapped bythe story itself. It has the impact and depth that Mirai Nikki tried and failed.",

      "review": "Yumi to kurumi is a bittersweet slice of life tale that illustrates one's personal growth and happiness in a shott span of 8 chapters.    Enter the life of Yumi Tanaka; a socially inept office lady who thinks lowly of herself. After stumbling upon a sentient doll that deems to bring happiness to its owners, Yumi's life began to change for the better.   For a relatively short read we got to see Yumi's healthy development of becoming a better person, that doesn't feel forced or shallow in a way that got me intrigued as to how it will goes down. The story itself is cute and simple, andeasy enough to follow, as it is short, however the shortness of the story is also its shortcoming: It is very shortlived that I wished there were more chapters to further explore more of the story. \n    As for the art, the artworks and paneling are smoothly drawn and articulate to follow, it synergizes well with the cute and innocent artstyle. \n\n Overall, I'd rate this manga a 6/10, I honestly can't rate it any higher. It has good potential and  I wish there was more to it. Yet I would still recommend it when you got 20-30 minutes or to spare.",

That means the first part of the story, the initial escape, I already knew and love. Great story, concept and pacing. The second part was practically all new to me and it was good fun. A lot of new characters that helped make this world feel alive, and a great adventure that never felt too grand for our main cast. I loved how all the characters were important, not necessarily to the plot but to Emma(our main POV), with such intensity that you really cared for them all. The worldbuilding was really good too, giving this story very solid surroundings that never felt like they had any conceptual holes.\n\nIn the end, it didn't open my third eye but I did tear up a time or two and the work is definitely of quality. Not a favourite, but a very solid recommendation that I'm sure a wide public can enjoy.",

      "review": "This story is honestly just pretty good from beginning to end. It was a pretty interesting twist to the whole monster invasion dungeon gate genre. Where our main character instead of using something like a system or an op ability gets a pretty interesting ability which at first won't seem like it would be pretty powerful but by coincidence and fate the ability became really useful. The original premise is actually pretty interesting and exciting but the plot was carried out fairly blandly and the characters are also very bland where they basically only have 1 characteristic and are never developed further. I literally don'tremember any part of the manhwa where I felt truly hype and truly felt with the characters of the story. The ending especially is not good it was rushed and so many stupid things happened that made it lose all stakes. It is long so I actually won't recommend if you are looking for something to read, but if you are looking for specifically a gate dungeon type manhwa this one ain't bad.",

      "review": "I appreciate this more than I enjoyed this. It is trying to be something, something a little different to your typical 2 character manga. I'm not entirely sure it quite accomplishes it at a level where I could call it a good story. Some stories can have quite unrealistic relationships, in terms of closeness, love at first sight, drop everything to be with this person you just met, unroot your life completely because of this dude, that can be quite overwhelming. This does the opposite, but veers too far in its own direction goes back to feeling too strange and frustrating. They want to be close,they want to be together but they respect each other's boundaries; they respect them too much, and their relationship ends up feeling limp and unfinished. Its progression chapter-to-chapter felt unfocused and pointless. Overall it feels unfinished. Overall it needed more drama, more conflict, to challenge the characters, and it felt like the author didn't know how to add that here because they made the relationship so very delicate that if it was poked too hard it would simply evaporate, but if that really is the case, is that something worth caring about?\n\nThe art is amazing, though. Just by the art alone, I think this is worth reading.",

      "review": "This is my honest opinion, I am NOT being a contrarian just because this is one of the most famous manga. - Cons Bleach is mostly Boring. The manga is made up of 95% fighting, 5% training and SOL moments. This might be good for some people who prefer nothing but action, but this is such a major flaw. Because not only is the amount of fighting so skewed, the fights themselves are extremely boring and predictable. A large majority of the fights can be taken out of the manga and ZERO plot would be lost. Not only that, the fights follow an unbearable structure of\"Bad guy powers up, Good guy powers up too, Bad guy powers up again, Good guy powers up again, Bad Guy powers up with their hidden power/move, but it turns out all along the Good guy could also power up with a secret move and oh look the Good guy was overpowered to begin with\". That fake tension and constant, unending \"But what will you do against *THIS* move\" that they keep pulling out of the hat every time you think the fight will end is nauseating and completely pulls you out of the experience by DRAGGING on for so, SO long. All these elements are doubly offensive when the manga speedruns everything that isn't fighting. Ichigo will train for 3 days, or 10, or 15 minutes in a different dimension where time is slowed and BARELY anything is shown, he just shows up with new power and we see next to nothing of his struggles unlike something like Dragon Ball. The manga isn't comfortable outside of fights. Most of the arcs are overly long due to all these compounding issues, and have nothing of substance. This manga put me to sleep multiple times, and I still binged it in less than 10 days. The ending was also infamously awful, but that was due to Bleach being cancelled abruptly as well as Kubo's health issues in the last arc, but it still leaves a sour taste in your mouth. \n\n- Pros\nThe only good thing this manga does exceptionally well is its characters, which is odd because they barely get any time to develop because of all the fighting. But Kubo has crafted every character to be unique and memorable, and all have their own ambitions and good and bad points. You will forget the fights, not the characters. Some mystery elements and the world in general are intriguing, but not nearly as much as Naruto or One Piece. Character designs are cool and have hidden meanings, the music that Kubo assigns to specific characters are fitting and add that extra layer of depth. Despite the fights being boring, there are genuinely some great fights, but few and far between. Some of the comedy is funny. The Art is good too, sometimes great! \n\n- Overall thoughts\n\nThis is the last of the BIG 3 I read, and It baffles me that this manga/anime is held up to Naruto and One Piece as equals. \n\nIf you enjoy endless, mindless fights with no substance, give it a shot. Otherwise, stay away from this Boring slog.",

É uma tortura para os leitores. Se você está aqui por algum colega seu te fazer desafios como \"duvido conseguir ler este manga ate o final\", acredite, não vale a pena. Não agrega em nada, nem sequer é interessante. É apenas uma historia sobre pessoas conturbadas que sofrem a cada capítulo, não de forma construtiva ou interessante, apenas cruel e desumano. Não leva a lugar nenhum, é ruim do inicio ao fim. A arte é agradável, um traço jogadono lixo ao ser utilizado nessa obra. Personagens principais tem suas historias perturbadoras reveladas durante a história onde, para variar, é baseado em manipulação psicologia, abuso familiar, aliciação e etc. Puramente desagradável, deprimente.",

The story is very well done and has no loose ends. the art is simply magnificent! I got emotional with the ending and enjoyed every moment, there wasn't a bad part! The protagonist is wonderful and VERY realistic, you really feel in his shoes. The antagonists are awesome too, if I can call them \"antagonists\". I think it's hard for a suspense to hold so much. Several moments I had my jaw dropped and I read everything very quicklyfor that too.",

      "review": "I used to think classic works were not so generic, perhaps my perception was wrong. As I came across Pluto’s ending it sure felt generic. Anyway, to start, the first 2 volumes were really great, I was so invested in it but after that somewhere along the way I couldn’t find the same enjoyment & wanted to finish it as soon as possible. The anti robot religious group had potential but wasted it very hilariously. And what happened to Adolf and his family afterwards? They just left him alone or what? Why did Gesicht have so much hatred? Why was his memory erased? So manyquestions left untold.\n\nBeing the greatest of Robots except Gesicht and Atom all the others were lackluster! What was the point of being called the advanced destruction weapons when you can’t even behave like a robot, like they were literally more human than humans themselves. Don’t even talk about feats, except Gesicht  and Atom all the other robots were feat less fodder man how can they be called the greatest of robots when they acted kinda pathetic or should I a even a human could have done better for the story with a Iron man suit than those robots.\n\nGesicht was charismatic and as a character entertaining but the moment he died This manga lost its charm and I lost my will. Gesicht  could have finished the story,It was his duty, responsibility but no the author had to revive Atom.\nAntagonist of this Manga was also a disappointment. I don't know how the robots lost to that piece of crap! “God of war” what a pathetic joke!\n\nThe art was good and in some panels great, no complaints in that part, It was detailed enough for my taste.\n \nI don’t really think this work should be considered a masterpiece as it seems a lot of people think that way. But there were some good parts too. Certainly this is not a bad manga or perhaps I expected a little more.",

      "review": "Definitely a cute read, the first chapter is a bit of \"oh so we got that heartless slut seme then\" but that thought was incorrect, the seme is loving and caring for the uke, he is careful with him during their first time and there is consent! There is no unnecessary drama or drama for that matter, thankfully no cheating/NTR and NO SA SCENES. The story revolves around them both and even continues a bit after they get together which was nice to see, we get to see a nice time skip as well which is cute. The name the ML gives the MCis also cute and also chapter 2 (maybe it was chapter 1 at the end of it) was hilarious so it has some comedy as well. \nThankfully no annoying characters or anything and even the one person who finds out about their relationship is understanding which we like to see! Definitely a cute read!",

      "review": "Our Party Is Wrong, or Oretachi no Party wa Machigatteiru, is the title of this ostensibly fantasy and comedy manga, but should really be called in my opinion as, Our Party Is Messed Up. The story has a party of four adventurers, a quartet of tabletop fantasy role playing game analogues with job titles for names, were about to subjugate the demon lord of their world. In an act of spite and survival, casting the spells sealed the demon lord for a year as a tactical retreat, the four adventurers got a different curse each. That’s where the fun begins. This was a short series,30 chapters collected in 3 volumes. No obvious indication it had an abbreviated run, given an ending that was satisfying, of sorts, and true to the irreverent spirit of the story. This story was built to run for a long time, given that the characters had job titles for names, and characterization based on cliches, and tropes found in other fantasy stories. \n\nAs I said, the fun begins when the curses kicked in disrupted the relationship dynamics between the party members for comedy as only gender bending, and de-aging can do. Imagine an ardent womanizer knight whose preference turned opposite and chasing men as he did skirts. A tsundere mage prince turned female and still a tsundere. A warrior at his prime physical peak turned into an early pubescent version of himself without the muscles sounds to be the only “normal” curse, but he must deal with the unwanted sexual advances of the pervert knight and his growing attraction to female version of the tsundere prince. They all need to deal with these changes while looking for the final missing member of their party. \n\nIn the second volume, the main cast deal with another party of ninjas, led by the man named Ninja, keeping to the theme of having job titles for names. They have a vendetta against the pervert knight that was seeded in one of the early chapters, and their encounters with the cursed crew proved to be interesting and entertaining. \n\nIn the third volume, the author wraps it all, introducing one new key supporting character, while keeping the rest to be background characters, and culminating in one final fateful encounter with the missing cursed party member.  \n\nThe plotting is tight, with all important story threads converging and resolving in the third volume. Hence, my impression that this is as intended all along. \n\nI recommend this to anyone looking for a fantasy or comedy manga series with low commitment to read while waiting for the next chapter for their main favorite series. It is entertaining, and I’m surprised there is no official English version of it yet.",

      "review": "It is safe to say that this manga definitely is not for everyone. If you are a fan of militaria and real-robot mecha, you should give this manga a try, but if not, go read something else. It should be noted that even though this takes place in the Front Mission universe (during the events of the first game to be exact), you do not need to be familiar with the Front Mission series to enjoy this manga. I think everything you need to know about the setting is explained very well to newcomers. I think what holds this story down the most is the author'sreliance on shock value. He wants to show you how horrible war can be: youre seeing civilians getting mowed down, women being raped, torture, and other warcrimes. But after so many tragedies youre just like \"oh come on\". And its grating how the USN in this story acts nothing like how they did in the games. In the games, neither side was completely good or evil. It wanted to show you that both factions had good people and bad people within their ranks, and how war was rarely just good vs evil. In DL&amp;DS, the USN faction seems to be completely filled with subhuman ogre men who think of nothing but murder and rape, where Nanking is just another Tuesday.\n\nAnother thing to be aware of is it seems the author was very horny when writing this. Almost every arc has a sex scene in it, or at the very least a character doing something weird and pervy. Now, some people like their stories to be full of sex. But if you are like me, seeing two characters who don't even love eachother have passionless sex will keep you rolling your eyes over many pages.\n\nNow lets talk about the good things in this manga.\n\nAs stated in the previous paragraph, this manga is separated into arcs; each arc being its own self-contained story that gives you different perspectives on the Huffman conflict. So its not just about the mech pilots, but also the grunts, the civilians, the media, and others. The quality of each arc wavers between being great and kinda sucking, but none of them are so bad that it would warrant skipping. Besides, there are a few reoccurring characters throughout the manga, so it is worth seeing how all these connected stories culminate, especially for one specific character.\n\nBut If there is one thing that is consistent, it is the art. The mechanical designs of the Wanzers and other military vehicles and gear look great, and the battles are epic. Its the type of manga that has certain pages where youll catch yourself looking at them for minutes, admiring all the detail put into it. The character designs are good too. You can totally check out this manga for the art alone if thats the type of person you are.",

      "review": "One of the best mangas I've ever read. The only reason this manga did not land on a 10/10 is because of a few key points that I believe the author could have avoided. The base story is boy meets girl, boy and girl get together for a band and romance follows. But the author makes this typical romance saga into a drama full of tragedy and hope, the likes of which is rarely seen in this medium. Let's begin with the breakdown. What makes this manga good is the storytelling, the drama, the tragedies and the feelings of hope. It's a story that brings tearsof sadness and tears of joy and a mix in between. To break down what makes this storytelling so good is to describe it as follows: It's real. The story in a lot of ways feels real and that's important to understand for how excellent it is. The characters' relationships, their emotions, their reactions. Some feel exaggerated, of course, this is a manga after all, but a lot of it is real. It's not just the storytelling either, but the art depicting each emotion in a perfect way. \n\nBut what makes this weaker is the comedy and lewd aspects of it. In this tragic drama that's also filled with so much hope and promise, the comedy attempts fall flat. There's not a single unique joke in this entire story and considering the surrounding story it doesn't feel natural. The lewd art could have been avoided as well without removing from the story. It doesn't add and it feels pointless. The ending doesn't feel rushed, it's perfect but there are two relations that occur in the ending that also feel unnatural, although that won't be covered further in this review.",

      "review": "As an artist myself, this was a bit difficult in the beginning. Him suddenly getting blind because of his work, made me quite anxious, not gonna lie. Being blind surely is scary for everyone, but even harder for people, whose work requires them to see. Authors can still easily write after becoming blind, but artists? Drawing without eyes is a bit difficult. Anyways. The beginning was good. I don't really like reading hetero stories, so I didn't go in with many expectations, but actually got surprised for the better. Sori's and Min's relationship was really healthy and I could truly feel their love for each other.They were happy and actually couple goals.\n\nBut then the whole jealousy plot started and it really just got exhausting to read. It started around chapter 10 and stretched throughout chapter 82, with only there being a character development.\nIt wasn't even them. Usually romance stories have love-triangles, that involves the MCs directly, because either one of them can't let their ex go or whatever, right? This was worse, even. The MCs were just pawns here, pushed around by everyone. Trying to hold on to their love for each other, but their disabilities getting in the way and making it easier for the antagonists to intervene. It really was just the antagonists working together to get what they want, without the MCs even knowing what's going on. Just pushed around like babies, naive and unable to do anything.\nBut not quite. Sori was just that throughout the whole story, but Min kept becoming more of a jerk too. He lied so much to her. It was so unfair. She kept working hard to earn money, even going for a modeling career because it would give him enough money for an eye surgery; and what does he do? Lie. Lie about his condition, that he's gonna die soon. Kept pretending everything's fine, while she was the one worrying. He lied about his mother at first too, they overcame that step, and he promised to never lie to her again. ... He managed about 2 weeks before lying again. It's just sad. I feel so bad for Sori.\n\nI genuinely don't know how I managed to keep reading. I'm so tired and energy-deprived. I'm not even sad, even though this was supposed to be a drama and emotional. I really didn't care anymore for the characters by the end. I just wanted it to end. And when it finally did, I felt nothing. Empty shell. Just glad it's over.\nOnly sad part being is that I hoped for a good story. There aren't many comics about deaf or blind characters, especially not two disabled MCs. So, of course you'd hope for it to be good, right? Sadly it's not. Unless you're a huge fan of extreme drama and jealous characters, who'd do everything to get what they want, even if it'll hurt the person they \"love\", this might be your next favorite. But unfortunately I'm not a drama-loving person. It's fine to some extent, but this was too much.\n\nIf the book was only from chapter 0 to around 30, I'd probably give it 5 stars. As said, I really liked it at the beginning. I teared up lots of times. Some of the early chapters are quite emotional and reflective.\nSadly only gets downhill and the focus shifts to the jealous side characters, who will do anything to force the people they \"love\" to be with them. Worst part is they didn't even get lectured for it. Sure, they didn't get to be with them in the end, but one of them should actually sit in jail. But does he? No. He's free as ever and even has a family. So disgusting.\n\n~\n\nI've heard a lot of criticism about the art, but I have to disagree on that. It might not be very clean and aesthetically pleasant, and there are much better works which are much older than this, but it works for the story. Even with that much drama, it is still a slice of life story. It's not bad. It might be bad for every other story, and might seem a bit lazy too, but that's life isn't it?\nI've seen lots of people especially criticize the crying. That it's ugly. Well, surprise, crying in real life is ugly too. If you want Disney-crying, go watch a disney movie or read a fantasy story. But this is a slice of life and drama story about hardships. You think you look pretty when you have a breakdown and cry your soul out? Probably not. In my opinion, it would've been worse and taken away the realistic part, if the author gave them princess-faces during the crying panels.\nYes, some of the expressions look ugly, but that's what makes it good.\n\nAnother point I liked, but many disliked for some reason: the comedy. While it was a lot and sometimes a bit unnecessary maybe, it was a part I'm glad the author kept. With all the extreme drama going on, the comedy brought the story down to earth again, reminding you that it's slice of life. And with all the eye-rolls I've done, the funny bits made me smile again. Forgot all the tension for a moment and could enjoy at least one or two panels, before it went annoying again.\n\nI also didn't mind the POVs and backstories from the other characters, and even the pets. It was random, true, but in a good way. You don't normally get this much screen-time for background characters like this, so it was interesting getting to know them more.\nNice world-building and reminds you once more that everyone goes through hardships, all the time, even though they are not the MC. Sounds obvious but, admit it, we do keep forgetting that sometimes.\n\n~\n\nAs with every book, there were good and bad parts. For this, the bad parts weigh down more than the good ones, sadly.\nDo I recommend it? Not really.\nIf you only want to read it because of the blind and deaf representation, go ahead. That part is more or less well-made. And the way they communicate is wholesome.\nBut if you actually want to enjoy the 84 chapters and are hoping for a good story, then don't. Unless, as said, you're a drama-fan, this is rather tiresome to digest. The ending isn't even worth all that and was very predictable anyways. Fairy-tale like.\n\n~\n\nIs there strong character development? Chapter 0-81? No. They only got worse. Chapter 82-83? Yes. Suddenly a 180 degree change.\nDid you find the characters loveable? I liked 2 characters; Sori and Yeom. Dong also a bit, but his crush on that one girl is a huge toxic trait. Otherwise every character is just annoying or an asshole or both.\nWould you say the cast of characters is diverse? Apart from the deaf and blind character (and the grandpa who wears leggings and heels (he's slaying those looks btw)), no. Everyone else is stereotypically k-drama. Very extreme and alike.\nAre the flaws of the main character(s) a main focus of the book? Yes. Their flaws are their main personality. It's not just \"flaws\", it really is incredibly toxic. Most know of their \"flaws\" but don't even bother to change.",

      "review": "The other reviewer obviously didn't grasp what they were reading, even a little, and their assessment that the piece was empty of meaning or value or merit is incredibly unfair. Even calling it hentai at all simply because it has sexual content at its core proves the reviewer's failure to understand the author's intent or even the genre of the work. To be clear: this is a work of SURREALIST HORROR. The sexual content isn't meant to arouse, it's not \"sick and twisted\" out of some extreme fetish --the effect on the reader of making them feel disturbed and disgusted is fully intentional. Much like thelegendary H.R Giger, who also worked in the surrealist horror genre and made extensive use of sexual imagery, the point is to assault the reader's sense of the natural order and well-being through vulnerable vectors like sexuality and gore in order to induce intense visceral reactions.\n\nThe work is crafted to use shock and revulsion and insane levels of outrageous strangeness to shake the reader's sense of reality and normality and orientation within a world that makes sense. It's not meant to be a pleasant experience, quite the opposite it's meant to assault your mind with disorienting violations of the fundamentals of reality in order to leave you in a profoundly disturbed state akin to vertigo. The more messed up you feel after reading it, the more effectively the author / artist has done his job.\n\nSurrealist horror is certainly not a genre for everyone, especially when it's as extreme as this. This is the very outer fringe of an already niche genre, and so it's only suitable for those who want and are prepared for that kind of content and the intense experience it provides.\n\nIf you are one of those surrealist horror junkies for whom too much is never enough, or just curious about how crazy it can get on the ragged fringe of the darkest corners of the human imagination, then step right up you are in for one hell of a ride. Everyone else, I very much suggest heeding the content disclaimers and look for something a bit milder than the equivalent of ghost pepper salsa.",

      "review": "Just the basic concept of world building when MC (human) saves an Elf (FMC). The story progresses, and... The characters and their interactions are cute. Disappointed that the FMC & MC didn't even kiss in the entire manga. There's hardly any Nudity and Romance, given that it has these tags. Standard Romance between an Elf and a Human. Innocent elf who doesn't know about the human world, and it's really funny at times. Having read similar stories over the years, this manga doesn't satisfy my desire. Based on my standards, an Elf is one of the sexiest being in fantasy genre, and there's so muchpotential if you wanna make stories on them. Thanks anyway, and hope many of you will enjoy! \n\n5/10.",

      "review": "A revenge fantasy with glimmers of an intriguing narrative, but lack of focus undercuts its potential. Story: 4/10 The betrayed player sent back in time premise shows promise and offers some interesting lore reveals. However, abrupt time skips and pacing issues cause the narrative to feel disjointed at times. The ending cuts off abruptly with no resolution. Art: 7/10 The polished, clean art style serves the story adequately. Action flows smoothly when present. Character designs are somewhat generic but serviceable. Characters: 3/10 The protagonist is an average power fantasy vessel, but his ruthless pursuit of revenge has its appeal. Supporting characters are one-note. Antagonists' motivations remain unclear.Enjoyment: 5/10\nDespite issues with narrative flow and weak characterization, I still found the revenge-driven plot moderately entertaining. The story showed sparks of potential.\n\nIn summary, Kill the Hero is a deeply flawed but sporadically entertaining revenge fantasy. Buried under messy plotting are glimmers of an intriguing narrative. It may appeal to power fantasy fans willing to overlook its issues.",

I completed this manga like a month ago and still can feel the heartwarming vibe this manga gave me. First the art style, it is so finely done, I highly appreciate those watercolor arts, it's so calming. The story begins after the main character looses his beloved. His own child, out of nowhere came to see him, Koharu- a sweet and cute girl and Masamune- a fellow nerd i could say. The emotional feeling between them is so well presented. The ending chapters mademe emotional. I would highly recommend this to everyone. Give it a go, you would merrily love it.\n\n.",

I love the main character mashle thoroughly but the side characters definitely leave a lot to be desired. While the main side characters are pretty cool and I do get hyped for them when they battle I don't really care as much as I would with other series. I wouldn't say the plot is bland but it definitely isn't all that great. The plot is pretty straight forward which I like but it doesn't give the chance to really explore theworld. I like that it didn't stretch that long and that it ended at a decent high note. In the end it is a good read but don't expect a revolutionary or insanely intricate story. Just a good read for a fun time.",

      "review": "Read Ashita no Joe, they said. It's one of those recommendations that say absolutely nothing... And holy shit. Truth be told, this was tougher to read than Berserk. It certainly doesn't feel that way at first, owing to its classical cartoonish style and setup. You couldn't guess how deep this goes on first glance. On second glance. On third glance, because Joe just keeps going. Because unlike Berserk, which requires a good attachment to the cast in addition to its bountiful artwork, Ashita no Joe does not care about your feelings. It only requires you to keep reading, to keep watching Joe in the same wayhe asks Shiraki Yoko to never turn away from true greatness.\n\nThe story kicks off with Joe being a dexterous ruffian. But when he finds himself in juvenile detention, he answers his life's calling to become a boxer. Throughout his journey, he quickly realizes that he is alone in the ring and revels in it. Fight after fight, Joe defies all expectations. The beauty of tomorrow is promising yet ephemeral. Tomorrow will only feature brutal bruises, bloody wounds, and the dust of dust. To everyone else, it is a revolting sight. But to him... That's tomorrow's Joe.\n\nOne thing I found very appalling is the sparse development among its well-written characters. Of course, it's not to say that there's a lack thereof, but it's assumed because the manga overall doesn't need it. Most side characters only grow through the passage of time. Joe goes through intense arcs of emotion and isolation, but quickly grows from it and subtly matures into an apex predator, looking forward to yet another tomorrow. He might continue to thrash around like an unhinged monkey, because one can argue that Joe's fists go through more character development than what Joe displays. But deep down he is one of the most mature sportsman you'll ever witness. All it took was a few moments of tenderness, ones that showcased how attuned he is to reality moreso than anyone else in the room. And he's the one taking all of the punches!\n\nMy god, dude. From his clash with Rikiishi all the way to the final bout, there's this uncanny hook in this manga that keeps you reading. A significant part of it is due to its simplistic structure and pacing, never dragging on and never a bore. Another significant part is the timeless style this manga is drawn in, giving it quite the unique and fresh vibe even today. And what would the manga be without the titular character himself? What would Joe be without the ego, the triple counter, the tenacity of a god to eat all of those punches? One word. Weak.\n\nSo, if you want to set baseline expectations, you should watch Megalobox first. It's a show that's directly inspired by Ashita no Joe, though set in a different universe and much more digestible. Megalobox's characters, premise, and some story beats are vastly similar to Ashita no Joe, though their journeys are wildly different owing to its styles. Megalobox presents boxing as a symphonic spectacle. While Ashita no Joe is basically the same thing, it's much more nuanced than a symphony. It's a deathmatch in hell.\n\nIn conclusion,\n\nIt's very difficult to describe the entirety of Ashita no Joe in a single word, but I think I can.\n\nTomorrow's Joe is UNBELIEVABLE. 10/10.\n\nUntil next time.",

      "review": "I have never read such a bad work from any author that clearly has several mental and personal issues that he needs to work on before committing himself to a manga, as they clearly leak into the story creating a completely apalling experience when reading it, as you can only feel the mental issues of the mangaka hidden behind a layer of irony called plot. You can clearly see that the author is not trying to write a coherent plot, nor trying to develop a set of characters and making a character focused manga (like for example, Vagabond), but he's just trying to dump as many'bizarre' sexually-inspired situations. The manga reads as a outlet for a sexually repressed male.\n\nExpanding on the characters - the manga could have benefited much more from a multi-focused approach, developing more the main character brothers, as well as the recruiter with glasses.\n\nIn short - this work is not to be considered a 'real' manga perse, but just the ramblings of a starting mangaka.",
